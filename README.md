Gameplay:
The main objective of the game is to beat the dealer and win more coins to be in
the top 5 highest coins in the hall of fame. First you need to register to get your free 1000
coins and login into the game to play. Place your bet and deal your first two cards. You
can “Hit” for another card and get your score close to 21 as you can without going bust
(score is greater than 21). Win many games to collect more coins to be in the hall of fame.

Game Mechanics:
• The player must bet first before dealing cards.
• Player can “Hit” for another card to make the score closer to 21 without going bust.
• If the player busted, the dealer automatically wins.
• If the player doesn’t want to hit for another card, player can directly evaluate and show the result.
• The score that is closer or equal to 21 wins.
• If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving
a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack."
• If the dealer has a blackjack, the player automatically loses.
• If both dealer and player have the same score, the game will be a tie meaning no one wins.
• Every time the player loses, player’s bet will be ducted from the player’s remaining coins.
• Otherwise, if the player wins, the bet will be added to the player’s coins.
• If the player run’s out of coins, 1000 coins will automatically add to the player’s coins.
